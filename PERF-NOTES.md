# Atom Forge V22–V26 — engine performance notes

The physics is unchanged: the same potentials, events, step-size rules and energy bookkeeping. What changed is how the
engine stores and visits particles.

## Particle store (struct of arrays) — `engine.js`, top
- `S` holds the hot per-particle data in typed arrays indexed by a particle's slot `p.i`: `x y vx vy fx fy gx gy ox oy m im q qp`
  (Float64), `k dead fast rad fresh ballistic inMD nearIon ionic isMetal anti xferD xferA` (Uint8), `Z ne cap used` (Int16),
  `mol id hit` (Int32), plus `ljR ljS ionR sEN elrc` (Float64) for the pair loop. `S.obj[i]` is the particle object.
- Particle objects are now instances of `class Part`: those fields are accessors onto the store, every other field is an
  ordinary property. All existing code (`p.x`, `p.dead = true`, `p.q + p.qp` …) works unchanged; the hot loops read the
  arrays directly.
- Slots are reused. A dead particle keeps its slot until `step()` drops it from `W.parts`; `freeSlot` then detaches the
  handle (its last values become plain properties, `dead` stays true), so stale references in the UI remain harmless.
  `clearWorld` and the builder's private world (`mbRelax`) give their slots back the same way (`dropParts`).
- `_PI` mirrors `W.parts` as slots (`partsSync()`); `pushPart` and the compaction keep it current, any other replacement of
  `W.parts` is caught and rebuilt.

## Neighbour lists
- `VL`: Verlet list of nucleus–nucleus pairs within `RC + SKIN` (SKIN = 1 Å), built from the cell grid, kept while the set
  of MD particles (`_mdGen`) and the box are unchanged and no nucleus has moved more than SKIN/2. Each pair carries an
  exclusion mark (`vlExclusions`, recomputed on `W.topo`/`W.dirty` changes): 1 = same molecule and excluded (skipped),
  2 = same molecule and interacting (no Set lookup needed), 0 = different molecules.
- `FL`: the free leptons' list — lepton–atom and lepton–lepton pairs within `RC + SKIN_F` (SKIN_F = 2 Å) — used by the inner
  (RESPA) steps and by `computeForces` for every pair with a free lepton. Rebuilt when the MD set changes or anything
  has moved more than SKIN_F/2 (a lepton moves at most 0.2 Å per inner step). It replaces the per-inner-step cell sorts.
- The cell grid (`G`) is still rebuilt at every `computeForces` (cells ≥ 8 Å), so `nearby()`, `localPE` and the event code
  see exactly what they saw before.
- The angle (VSEPR) centres, their neighbours and target angles are cached (`AC`) and refreshed on `W.topo`/`W.dirty`
  changes; two-bond centres take a sort-free path; bond directions give sin/cos without trig calls.

## Pair kernel and worker threads (V23)
- The nucleus pair physics (atom–atom, bare nuclei, antimatter), the Morse bonds and the angle terms are *kernels* between
  the `PAIR KERNEL BEGIN/END` markers in `engine.js`: they read the store `S`, the bond arrays `BD` and the angle centres
  `AC` only — never a particle object — and write forces into whatever output arrays they are given. Where the old code
  queued an event, a kernel notes a *candidate* `(kind, i, j)`; `evalCandidates` turns candidates into events on the main
  thread, in the order noted, with the chemistry that needs the objects (`reaction`, `covalentOK` …). One thread or
  many therefore queue the same events in the same order.
- `threads.js` runs the kernels in Web Workers over the shared store (`SharedArrayBuffer`): `build.js` embeds the kernel
  text as `PAIR_KERNEL_SRC`, and `workerSource()` adds the constants and zbl helpers from the live code. Each force
  pass: the main thread hands every worker a range of pairs, bonds and centres (shared control words, `Atomics.wait`
  in the workers, a spin on the main thread), computes its own ranges into `S.fx/fy`, then every slot's forces are
  summed over the workers' buffers in a fixed order (the reduction is shared out too) and the candidates evaluated in
  list order. Deterministic for a given thread count; equal to one thread to rounding (`t_threads`).
- Needs a cross-origin isolated page (COOP `same-origin` + COEP `require-corp`): the desktop app serves it so
  (`desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `app.security.headers`); a plain page keeps one thread. Settings → Threads
  (auto = all but one), Settings → Run benchmark. Worlds under ~1,500 pairs a thread stay on one thread.
- Store and list arrays that grow bump `_sharedGen`; the workers are rebound before the next pass (`threadsBind`).

## V24: the serial parts
- The grid's object list `G.list` is built only when something asks for it (`nearby`, `localPE` …); the force passes use
  slot indices. `_md` is gone (`_mdI` slots; `_mdL`, `_charged`, `_fastNuc` keep objects).
- Flag changes (`dead`, `fast`, `rad`) bump `_flagGen`; `listsStale`, the fast-lepton pass and the dead-particle
  compaction run only when something changed (`_nDead`, `_flagGen !== _flagGenForces`).
- With threads, the plain integration (no B field, no MD leptons, ≥ 2,000 slots) is shared out as well (`integrateA` →
  `integrateSlots` in the workers), the workers are woken at the start of the step (`threadsPrewake`), and the main
  thread takes half a worker's share of the pairs so it is free to drive the pass.

## V25: the force kernels in WebAssembly (`kernel/`, `src/wasm.js`)
- The pair, bond and angle kernels exist twice: the JavaScript ones (engine.js, PAIR KERNEL block) and a Rust port
  (`kernel/src/lib.rs`), the same arithmetic in the same order; they agree to rounding (`tests/t_wasm.js`, and
  `kernel/examples/check.rs` against a dump from `tools/kdump.js`). The only differences are exp/pow (the two libms) and
  atan2 (Cephes' rational approximation in `kernel/src/fastmath.rs`, ~1 ulp; the libm one was most of the angle kernel's
  time in WebAssembly). Both angle kernels use √(dx²+dy²) rather than hypot now.
- GitHub Actions builds the module (`.github/workflows/wasm.yml`: nightly Rust, std rebuilt with atomics, memory imported
  and shared, `__stack_pointer` and `__heap_base` exported) and commits it back as `src/wasm/kernel.wasm`; `build.js`
  embeds it as `KERNEL_WASM_B64`. Without the file the page is as before.
- Memory: when the module and shared memory are there (Node; a cross-origin isolated page), `shArray` carves every
  shared array — the store, the neighbour list, bonds, angle centres, force buffers, candidate queues — out of one shared
  `WebAssembly.Memory` with a bump allocator (`wasmArray`; 16 MB to start, grown as needed; growing keeps every view
  valid). A descriptor of byte offsets (`wasmDesc`) tells the kernel where the arrays are; it is filled before each pass.
  The main thread compiles the module in the background (synchronously in Node) and runs `af_forces` for its share; each
  worker instantiates the same module on the same memory with a stack of its own (`__stack_pointer`), and sums the force
  buffers with `af_sum`. A page without shared memory keeps plain typed arrays and the JavaScript kernels.
- Node, one thread: the kernels 2.5× faster (water 1.5 → 0.9 ms, flash byte 1.6 → 0.8), the step 4.3 → 3.6 ms (water)
  and 2.3 → 1.5 ms (flash byte). `node tools/kdump.js <scenario> out.bin` + `cargo run --release --example check -- out.bin`
  checks and times the native build; Settings shows the kernel in use.

## V26: collider RF, frame diagnostics, Select tool
- Rings lost particles at full energy (D + T at 10 GeV, kept apart: deuterons and tritons thrown out one by one at
  0.98c). The ramp's voltage — 12% of the energy a turn, from one cavity in the two-ring layout — kept kicking the held
  bunch by a tenth of its energy; with dispersion at the cavities every kick also grows the betatron amplitude, until
  the aperture (±8 Å) is reached. Now: four RF cavities per ring (two-ring layout: after cells 2, 3, 6, 7; single ring:
  left, right and beside the upper separators), so each kick is a quarter the size, and at full energy the voltage comes
  down adiabatically (`holdVoltage`, RF_HOLD_*) to what makes a bucket 8% of the energy high. Energy swings during the
  ramp fall from ±10% to ±3%, at full energy to ±2%; no losses in any of the sweep's cases.
- The fps badge shows the worst frame of each half second with where its time went (sim, draw, panels, or a gap between
  frames: the browser, GC) when it is over 40 ms — for chasing stutters.
- Select tool (T): a box picks particles (whole molecules by default; Shift adds or toggles), the selection can be
  dragged, Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V copy and paste (with bonds, at the pointer, only where there is room), Delete, Ctrl+A;
  also in the right-click menu. `tests/t_select.js`.

## V24: collider fix
- Beam particles scattered in a ring's detector (same-charge beams: e⁻ on e⁻, p on p …) are stopped by the detector
  (`detectorStop`, `p.caught`) instead of flying out through the magnets to the wall, which lost whole bunches as soon as
  the beams were brought together. The RF's synchronous phase while ramping is 49° (`RF_S0 = 0.75`, was 30°): the same
  gain per turn with a gentler kick, which roughly halves the energy excursions of a bunch during the ramp.

## Loops
`computeForces`, `chooseDt`, `outerA`, `innerSteps`, `outerB`, `computeFast`, `innerDt`, `leptonExtras`, `listsStale`,
`localTemps`, `moveFastLeptons` and the per-step loops in `step()` run over slots and typed arrays. `rotateB` returns into a
scratch pair, `hasEfield`/`hasBfield` allocate nothing, the bond loop reads slots. The drawing keeps ball sprites per colour
and radius without string keys and strokes bonds in batches (one path per colour, width class and opacity step).

## Measuring
- `node tools/bench.js [scenario|all] [steps]` (Node, deterministic): ms per step for the three benchmark worlds.
- `node tools/bench-page.js [steps]` (headless Chromium): the same inside the real page, plus simulation and drawing time per frame.
- `node tools/bench-frozen.js [scenario]`: ms per call of computeForces / computeFast / chooseDt / outerB on one frozen state (for A/B comparisons of versions, which otherwise diverge chaotically within a few dozen steps).
- `VL.builds / VL.checks` and `FL.builds / FL.checks` count list rebuilds against validity checks.
- `node tests/t_threads.js`: the worker threads in headless Chromium behind a COOP/COEP server (determinism, equality with one
  thread, events, energy, the plain page's fallback, the in-app benchmark).

## Desktop app (`desktop/`)
Tauri 2 shell around `dist/atom-forge.html` (staged to `desktop/dist-app/index.html` by `tools/stage-app.js`), with the
isolation headers in `tauri.conf.json`. `.github/workflows/desktop.yml` builds the Windows `.msi` and NSIS `.exe` on
GitHub's Windows runners (push to `main`, or run by hand; a `v*` tag makes a release). Locally on Windows: install Rust
(rustup) and run `cd desktop && npm install && npm run build`; the installers land in
`desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
