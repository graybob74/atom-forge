# Atom Forge V22/V23 — engine performance notes

The physics is unchanged: the same potentials, events, step-size rules and energy bookkeeping. What changed is how the
engine stores and visits particles.

## Particle store (struct of arrays) — `engine.js`, top
- `S` holds the hot per-particle data in typed arrays indexed by a particle's slot `p.i`: `x y vx vy fx fy gx gy ox oy m im q qp`
  (Float64), `k dead fast rad fresh ballistic inMD nearIon ionic isMetal anti xferD xferA` (Uint8), `Z ne cap used` (Int16),
  `mol id hit` (Int32), plus `ljR ljS ionR sEN elrc` (Float64) for the pair loop. `S.obj[i]` is the particle object.
- Particle objects are now instances of `class Part`: those fields are accessors onto the store, every other field is an
  ordinary property. All existing code (`p.x`, `p.dead = true`, `p.q + p.qp` …) works unchanged; the hot loops read the
  arrays directly.
- Slots are reused. A dead particle keeps its slot until `step()` drops it from `W.parts`; `freeSlot` then detaches the
  handle (its last values become plain properties, `dead` stays true), so stale references in the UI remain harmless.
  `clearWorld` and the builder's private world (`mbRelax`) give their slots back the same way (`dropParts`).
- `_PI` mirrors `W.parts` as slots (`partsSync()`); `pushPart` and the compaction keep it current, any other replacement of
  `W.parts` is caught and rebuilt.

## Neighbour lists
- `VL`: Verlet list of nucleus–nucleus pairs within `RC + SKIN` (SKIN = 1 Å), built from the cell grid, kept while the set
  of MD particles (`_mdGen`) and the box are unchanged and no nucleus has moved more than SKIN/2. Each pair carries an
  exclusion mark (`vlExclusions`, recomputed on `W.topo`/`W.dirty` changes): 1 = same molecule and excluded (skipped),
  2 = same molecule and interacting (no Set lookup needed), 0 = different molecules.
- `FL`: the free leptons' list — lepton–atom and lepton–lepton pairs within `RC + SKIN_F` (SKIN_F = 2 Å) — used by the inner
  (RESPA) steps and by `computeForces` for every pair with a free lepton. Rebuilt when the MD set changes or anything
  has moved more than SKIN_F/2 (a lepton moves at most 0.2 Å per inner step). It replaces the per-inner-step cell sorts.
- The cell grid (`G`) is still rebuilt at every `computeForces` (cells ≥ 8 Å), so `nearby()`, `localPE` and the event code
  see exactly what they saw before.
- The angle (VSEPR) centres, their neighbours and target angles are cached (`AC`) and refreshed on `W.topo`/`W.dirty`
  changes; two-bond centres take a sort-free path; bond directions give sin/cos without trig calls.

## Pair kernel and worker threads (V23)
- The nucleus pair physics (atom–atom, bare nuclei, antimatter), the Morse bonds and the angle terms are *kernels* between
  the `PAIR KERNEL BEGIN/END` markers in `engine.js`: they read the store `S`, the bond arrays `BD` and the angle centres
  `AC` only — never a particle object — and write forces into whatever output arrays they are given. Where the old code
  queued an event, a kernel notes a *candidate* `(kind, i, j)`; `evalCandidates` turns candidates into events on the main
  thread, in the order noted, with the chemistry that needs the objects (`reaction`, `covalentOK` …). One thread or
  many therefore queue the same events in the same order.
- `threads.js` runs the kernels in Web Workers over the shared store (`SharedArrayBuffer`): `build.js` embeds the kernel
  text as `PAIR_KERNEL_SRC`, and `workerSource()` adds the constants and zbl helpers from the live code. Each force
  pass: the main thread hands every worker a range of pairs, bonds and centres (shared control words, `Atomics.wait`
  in the workers, a spin on the main thread), computes its own ranges into `S.fx/fy`, then every slot's forces are
  summed over the workers' buffers in a fixed order (the reduction is shared out too) and the candidates evaluated in
  list order. Deterministic for a given thread count; equal to one thread to rounding (`t_threads`).
- Needs a cross-origin isolated page (COOP `same-origin` + COEP `require-corp`): the desktop app serves it so
  (`desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `app.security.headers`); a plain page keeps one thread. Settings → Threads
  (auto = all but one), Settings → Run benchmark. Worlds under ~1,500 pairs a thread stay on one thread.
- Store and list arrays that grow bump `_sharedGen`; the workers are rebound before the next pass (`threadsBind`).

## Loops
`computeForces`, `chooseDt`, `outerA`, `innerSteps`, `outerB`, `computeFast`, `innerDt`, `leptonExtras`, `listsStale`,
`localTemps`, `moveFastLeptons` and the per-step loops in `step()` run over slots and typed arrays. `rotateB` returns into a
scratch pair, `hasEfield`/`hasBfield` allocate nothing, the bond loop reads slots. The drawing keeps ball sprites per colour
and radius without string keys and strokes bonds in batches (one path per colour, width class and opacity step).

## Measuring
- `node tools/bench.js [scenario|all] [steps]` (Node, deterministic): ms per step for the three benchmark worlds.
- `node tools/bench-page.js [steps]` (headless Chromium): the same inside the real page, plus simulation and drawing time per frame.
- `node tools/bench-frozen.js [scenario]`: ms per call of computeForces / computeFast / chooseDt / outerB on one frozen state (for A/B comparisons of versions, which otherwise diverge chaotically within a few dozen steps).
- `VL.builds / VL.checks` and `FL.builds / FL.checks` count list rebuilds against validity checks.
- `node tests/t_threads.js`: the worker threads in headless Chromium behind a COOP/COEP server (determinism, equality with one
  thread, events, energy, the plain page's fallback, the in-app benchmark).

## Desktop app (`desktop/`)
Tauri 2 shell around `dist/atom-forge.html` (staged to `desktop/dist-app/index.html` by `tools/stage-app.js`), with the
isolation headers in `tauri.conf.json`. `.github/workflows/desktop.yml` builds the Windows `.msi` and NSIS `.exe` on
GitHub's Windows runners (push to `main`, or run by hand; a `v*` tag makes a release). Locally on Windows: install Rust
(rustup) and run `cd desktop && npm install && npm run build`; the installers land in
`desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
